1. Get this working for finetuning with some payoff
2. Get it to work for all bandsets for all modalities
2. Integrate into pretraining

# How do I appropriately set these thresholds? Need to do some experimentation and visualization to determine the best thresholds.
- we want to be able to visualize the tokenization for some subet of example and also compute how many tokens would be used for different tasks as well




# Fixes
- Ensure the band order selection in the scorer is correct


# THoughts
- do we need the patch descriptor class
-  TOken counter and visualizer
