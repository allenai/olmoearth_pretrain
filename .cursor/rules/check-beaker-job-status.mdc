# Checking Beaker Job Status

## When to Use
Use this workflow when the user wants to check the status of their running or recent Beaker experiments.

## Step 1: Find Experiments

```bash
# List experiments in workspace (most recent first)
beaker workspace experiments ai2/earth-systems --text "<search_term>"

# Common search patterns:
# - By username: --text "henryh"
# - By project: --text "tokenization"
# - By date pattern in name: --text "2026_01"
```

Output shows: ID, NAME, WORKSPACE, AUTHOR, CREATED, STATUS, BUDGET

## Step 2: Check Experiment Status

```bash
# Quick status check (text format)
beaker experiment get <EXPERIMENT_ID>

# Detailed status with timestamps (json format)
beaker experiment get <EXPERIMENT_ID> --format json
```

## Step 3: Report Status to User

**ALWAYS report the status clearly using one of these categories:**

| Status in Output | Report As | Meaning |
|------------------|-----------|---------|
| `pending`, no `started` timestamp | **QUEUED** | Waiting to be scheduled |
| `running`, has `started` but no `exited` | **RUNNING** | Currently executing |
| `succeeded`, exitCode 0 | **SUCCEEDED** | Completed successfully |
| `failed`, exitCode != 0 | **FAILED** | Exited with error |
| `preempted` | **PREEMPTED** | Interrupted, may resume |
| `canceled` | **CANCELED** | Manually stopped |

**Example status report format:**
```
Experiment: base_all_bands_single_token-train-366f1c59
Status: **FAILED** (exit code 1)
Created: 2026-01-14 08:21:41
Started: 2026-01-14 08:57:29
Exited: 2026-01-14 08:59:23
Duration: ~2 minutes
```

## How to Determine Status from JSON

```bash
beaker experiment get <EXP_ID> --format json
```

Look at the `jobs[0].status` object:
- **QUEUED**: Has `created` but no `started`
- **RUNNING**: Has `started` but no `exited`
- **FAILED**: Has `exited` and `exitCode` != 0
- **SUCCEEDED**: Has `exited` and `exitCode` == 0

## Step 4: Check Individual Tasks/Jobs

```bash
# List all tasks in an experiment
beaker experiment tasks <EXPERIMENT_ID>

# Get details for a specific job
beaker job get <JOB_ID> --format json
```

## Step 5: Monitor Progress (for running jobs)

```bash
# Watch logs in real-time (useful for running experiments)
beaker experiment logs <EXPERIMENT_ID>

# Check experiment description (often contains progress info like step count)
beaker experiment get <EXPERIMENT_ID> --format json | grep description
```

## Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `beaker workspace experiments <workspace> --text "<pattern>"` | List/search experiments |
| `beaker experiment get <EXP_ID>` | Get experiment status |
| `beaker experiment tasks <EXP_ID>` | List tasks with their status |
| `beaker job get <JOB_ID>` | Get specific job details |

## Example: Check All Recent Experiments

```bash
# Find your recent experiments
beaker workspace experiments ai2/earth-systems --text "henryh"

# Output example:
# ID                          NAME                                    STATUS
# 01KEYN069TJM97JGNQ2TWRPH51  henryh/base_all_bands-train-366f1c59   1 failed
# 01KEYMZQQCW6SW71H8R7W2FD87  henryh/base_spectral-train-d2bc5c8c    running
# 01KEYMZA2EK7646BHTE0Y9TF6S  henryh/base_single_band-train-8e21bbbe succeeded

# Get details on running one
beaker experiment get 01KEYMZQQCW6SW71H8R7W2FD87 --format json
```

## Key Fields in JSON Output

When using `--format json`, key fields to look at:
- `status.exitCode` - 0 = success, non-zero = failure
- `status.created` - When experiment was submitted
- `status.started` - When it actually began running
- `status.exited` - When it finished (if done)
- `description` - Often contains progress info from wandb
